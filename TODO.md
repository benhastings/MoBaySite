TO DO
1. Sanctuary for the Saints large at top. Then, $1200 of $95,000 raised. Is there a way to put 30 sec audio here with something like "click here" to make it more obvious?


4. Words not on top of faces

5. Can increments be added to the money bar? Can the bar be vertical (maybe over to the right)

7. On laptop, as you scroll, the DONATE button is prominent at the top but the other words need to be seen (not white letters)


11. Take out THE CONGREGATION



17. How Much? The goal is $95,000 USD.  Every donation is helpful! God loves a cheerful giver (in italics) -2 Cor. 9:7.

	- Don't want to mention when construction can start?
	- "God loves a cheerful giver" seems a little blunt - the whole site is a plea for donation already... if you want it, I'll change it.  Just seems a little heavy handed to me.

DONE
2. "Providing the church in Montego Bay with a permanent home for worship and fellowship"
3. White lettering>make clearer>no pain in reading
6. Just "OVERVIEW"
A labor of love, this idea began Summer 2015 in the most recent visit to Jamaica. The Christians in Montego Bay have been assembling in a rented garage for more than 20 years. A number of dedicated Christians from America who have visited and worked with the Christians in Montego Bay are coordinating the construction of a building where the brethren can meet in peace and safety.
8. Under Brethren: add "40 souls" and tack on "....since 2002 in the same rented YMCA garage."
9. Under Meeting Outdoors: "The rented garage has only one room, so the adults meet indoors and the children meet outdoors. But the children can only meet when the weather allows."
10. Under Impacting Generations: "The church family in Montego Bay is young and growing. Building a safe and permanent sanctuary for the brethren and their guests will have an important impact on this city for years to come."
12. Challenging Circumstances
"The congregation faces many challenges because of their location. Not only are there time constraints due to the YMCA schedule, but also distractions from noise and music on neighboring properties."
13. One Family
"We are all one family in Christ, and God calls us to help our brothers and sisters. We ask you to pray for the success of this project, share our website with friends and family, and provide whatever financial assistance you can."
14. Amy's bio: change throughout to through
15. Change Scott and Sarah bio:  17 times over the last 13 years. Also change the 2nd sentence to "I've also traveled there and met the brethren."
16. Who is Involved? Individual Christians in Jamaica and America
19. Remove Brethren
20. Change to: How Can I Help?
	1. Pray for us!
	2. Share this website on social media
	3. (DONATE BUTTON)
21. Have one email option for Amy/general questions and one for Scott/financial questions
